# JavaScript Interview Questions

## Basic JavaScript Interview Questions

1. **What is JavaScript?**  
   JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language that has become a standard for client-side web development.

2. **What are the data types supported by JavaScript?**  
   JavaScript supports the following data types:  
    - Number  
    - String  
    - Boolean  
    - Object  
    - Undefined  
    - Null

3. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**  
   The `==` operator checks for value equality, while the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality. 

## Intermediate JavaScript Interview Questions

1. **Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.**  
   A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope. It allows a function to access variables from an enclosing scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

2. **What is event delegation?**  
   Event delegation is a technique that allows you to attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of attaching it to the individual child elements. This improves performance and allows you to manage dynamically added elements.

3. **What are Promises and how do they work?**  
   A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
